Project by Liao Hu, Omar Thenmalai

## Usage
### Tech Stack

- Maven, Spring

This project uses the `Maven` project manager and `Spring` as the framework.

To run the project, simply clone the project to a local directory and load the project with `IntelliJ IDEA`.

The server will launch on port 8080 (given that port 8080 is free).

### Front-end

Ensure that you have React downloaded before attempting to start the front-end application. 

To run the project, simply clone the project to a local directory. Open up a command line and navigate to the folder that contains the cloned repository. Use the following command:
```
npm start
```
to start the application. The application will load on "http://localhost:3000" and can be viewed in the browser. Ensure that the back-end is started on "http://localhost:8080", otherwise the various API calls will fail.
